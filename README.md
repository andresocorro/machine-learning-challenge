# Machine Learning

## Planet Exploration

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

Using Jupyter Notebook, matplotlib, sklearn, pandas to create machine learning models to gain an understanding of testing and classifying the different candidate planets into a confirmed, false positive or negative categories

## Preprocess the Data

### Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use MinMaxScaler to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters
* Use GridSearch to tune model parameters.
* Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.

# Results

 After performing the steps above using a SVM model and a logistic regression, the results were very similar with the SVM model returning .888 accuracy and the Logistic Regression model came back with a .884 accuracy
